In this activity we are going to be recreating the classic data visualization by Charles Minard, a French civil engineer and pioneer of data graphs.

Here is the original (switch to visual or a knitted version to view!)

[![](images/minard.png){width="895"}](http://minardmap.org/)

Poor Charles had to painstakingly draw this by hand. But we can use ggplot and just a few lines of code to do the same!

First (as always) we need to load our packages

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(formattable)
```

And then load the data that is behind this graphic. Thi data is split into two separate data frames:

-   troops contains latitude and longitude, the number of Napoleon's surviving troops over time, as well as whether they are advancing or retreating (coded as A or R)

-   cities contains the latitude and longitude of the towns and cities on this map (as well as their names)

```{r}
troops <- read.table("DataSets/minard-troops.txt", header=T)
cities <- read.table("DataSets/minard-cities.txt", header=T)
```

```{r}
troops
```

```{r}
cities
```

Now I'm **going to give you** the base code for how to re-create the classic plot using just the troop data for now. That's right you don't have to code it just yet.

Run the chunk below:

```{r}
plot_troops <- ggplot(troops, aes(long, lat)) +
  geom_path(aes(size = survivors, colour = direction, group = group))
plot_troops
```

Okay so it looks like we're on the right track but there's still some more work to be done.

Let's add the cities to the plot_troops graph now using geom_text()

*Notice that geom_text uses the "label" aesthetic which must be mapped to 'data=cities'*

```{r}
plot_both <- plot_troops + 
  geom_text(aes(label = city), size = 4, data = cities)
plot_both  
```

## So here's your first task

I want you to see what you can do to use scale and plot annotation modifiers (scale_x\_continuous(), labs(), theme(), etc) to make your plot look as much like the original as possible....**or to improve it**.

Here's the code again so you can do so.

Once you have a finished product, save it as a .png or .jpg file and upload it to the slack

```{r}
ggplot(troops, aes(long, lat)) +
  geom_path(aes(size = survivors, colour = direction, group = group)) + 
  geom_text(aes(label = city), size = 4, data = cities)

```
